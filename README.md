The [ZX-calculus](http://zxcalculus.com) gives us a handy way to represent and work with quantum computations. ZXLive is an interactive tool for working with ZX. Draw graphs or load circuits and apply ZX rules. Intended for experimenting, building proofs, helping to write papers, showing off, or simply learning about ZX and quantum computing. It is powered by the [pyzx](https://github.com/Quantomatic/pyzx) open source library under the hood. The documentation is available at https://zxlive.readthedocs.io/

This project is in a pretty early stage, with lots more to come. Have a look at the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/Quantomatic/zxlive/issues) to see what's in the pipeline.

# Documentation

This project uses Sphinx to build a ReadTheDocs page. In addition, it uses the MyST preprocessor to allow us to write documentation in a Markdown-like format rather than Sphinx's native rich structured text format.

The documentation can be built with

    cd doc
    make html
